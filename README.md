# Microsoft Chart for Windows Forms Samples Environment

This is a backup of the _Microsoft Chart for Windows Forms Samples Environment_ (Microsoft Chart Controls for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5), based on the following sources:

- [Microsoft Chart Control for .Net 3.5 SP1](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=130F7986-BF49-4FE5-9CA8-910AE6EA442C&displaylang=en)

- In addition, Microsoft has created a [Samples Environment](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/mschart) which I highly recommend downloading as it provides a great way to see all of the features of the controls. 

The [release](https://github.com/geomatics-io/Samples-Environments-for-Microsoft-Chart-Controls/releases) section provides a NuGet package which bundles the latest available release of the Microsoft Chart Controls.

The `src` folder holds a copy of the Samples Environment:
